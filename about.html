        <h3>OUR ORIGIN STORY</h3>
        <p>
            BIG STEPPA COFFEEHOUSE PASTRY AND BAKERY SHOP's Genesis was all orchestrated by MR TERRY.UNOPA.VALELA, the Founder in the year 2013, May 20 to be exact.
            His Late Great Grandmother, Iris Valela loved Coffee and baked Pastries so much that as a kid he would visit her and already knew she would prepare some tasty
            hand crafted steamy muffins to go with some coffee she harvested outside her plantation and cooked up herself as well. When she passed away in 2009, he thought why not open a Cafe shop
            to honour her memory. He imagined, planned then executed and today we have BIG STEPPA COFFEEHOUSE PASTRY AND BAKERY SHOP. The shop offers a safe space for coffee and baked goods lovers as well as
            a feeling of belonging or being at home because Terry felt that way always as he visited his Grandmother's place so he recreated that in his own way.
