    <h3>  OUR ORIGIN STORY </h3>

      His Late  Great Grandmother , Iris Valela loved Coffee and baked Pastries so much that as a kid he would visit her and already knew she would prepare some tasty 
      hand crafted steamy  muffins to go with some coffee she harvested outside her plantation and cooked up herself as well . When she passed away in 2009, he thought why not open a Cafe shop
      to honour her memory . He  imagined , planned then executed and today we have BIG STEPPA COFFEEHOUSE PASTRY AND BAKERY SHOP. The shop offers a safe space For coffee and baked goods lovers as well as 
      a feeling of belonging or being at home because Terry felt that way always as he visited his Grandother's place so he recreated that in his own way. </P>
